The cdr255 Script Suite

I do most of my work from the commandline. This means that,
when I am working on a project (a composition, a document,
a program, etc) I tend to do the same few tasks over and
over and over. Therefore, I started to script away the 
boring bits, so that I could stop using the drudgery and 
monotony (and relative safety) as an excuse to keep me from
working.

I recognize that these scripts have three flaws when it 
comes to something like distribution:

1. These are mostly tailored towards my own, personal use.
   to make them useful for You requires a review of the
   scripts and manual editing. I do not intend to add an
   automated customization script at this time.

2. These are my own, personal solutions to problems which
   have probably been solved previously by others. I do
   not mean to reinvent the wheel with this project, but
   in regards to any of the other solutions which I have
   come into contact with before starting this project, 
   they were not sufficient for my purposes. YMMV.

3. They depend on a lot of other software being present
   on the same system. For this, I have a file (DEPENDS)
   in the root of the project. To ensure that nothing 
   breaks, ensure that all of the software mentioned 
   there is installed.

If You have any questions or comments concerning these
scripts, this project, or any of my other projects,
please email me at cdr255@gmail.com. I would Love to 
talk to You about it.
